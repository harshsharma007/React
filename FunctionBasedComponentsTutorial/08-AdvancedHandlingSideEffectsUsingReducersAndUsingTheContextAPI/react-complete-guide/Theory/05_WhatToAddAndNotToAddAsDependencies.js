                In the previous lecture, we explored useEffect() dependencies.

                You learned, that you should add "everything" you use in the effect function as a 
                dependency - i.e. all state variables and functions you use in there.

                That is correct, but there are a few exceptions you should be aware of:

                - You DON'T need to add state updating functions 
                (as we did in the last lecture with setFormIsValid): React guarantees that those functions 
                never change, hence you don't need to add them as dependencies (you could though)

                - You also DON'T need to add "built-in" APIs or functions like fetch(), localStorage etc 
                (functions and features built-into the browser and hence available globally): These 
                browser APIs / global functions are not related to the React component render cycle and 
                they also never change

                - You also DON'T need to add variables or functions you might've defined OUTSIDE of your 
                components (e.g. if you create a new helper function in a separate file): Such functions 
                or variables also are not created inside of a component function and hence changing them 
                won't affect your components (components won't be re-evaluated if such variables or 
                functions change and vice-versa)

                So long story short: You must add all "things" you use in your effect function if those 
                "things" could change because your component (or some parent component) re-rendered. 
                That's why variables or state defined in component functions, props or functions defined 
                in component functions have to be added as dependencies!

                Here's a made-up dummy example to further clarify the above-mentioned scenarios:

                import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
                let myTimer;
                const MyComponent = (props) => {
                    const [timerIsActive, setTimerIsActive] = useState(false);
                
                    const { timerDuration } = props; // using destructuring to pull out specific props values
                
                    useEffect(() => {
                        if (!timerIsActive) {
                            setTimerIsActive(true);
                            myTimer = setTimeout(() => {
                                setTimerIsActive(false);
                            }, timerDuration);
                        }
                    }, [timerIsActive, timerDuration]);
                };

                In this example:

                - timerIsActive is added as a dependency because it's component state that may change 
                when the component changes (e.g. because the state was updated)

                - timerDuration is added as a dependency because it's a prop value of that component - so 
                it may change if a parent component changes that value 
                (causing this MyComponent component to re-render as well)

                - setTimerIsActive is NOT added as a dependency because it's that exception: State 
                updating functions could be added but don't have to be added since React guarantees that 
                the functions themselves never change

                - myTimer is NOT added as a dependency because it's not a component-internal variable 
                (i.e. not some state or a prop value) - it's defined outside of the component and 
                changing it (no matter where) wouldn't cause the component to be re-evaluated

                - setTimeout is NOT added as a dependency because it's a built-in API 
                (built-into the browser) - it's independent from React and your components, it doesn't 
                change
            */}
        </p>
    )
}
