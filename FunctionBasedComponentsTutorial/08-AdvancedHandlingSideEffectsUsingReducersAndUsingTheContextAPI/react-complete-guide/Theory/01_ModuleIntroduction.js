                With the core basics and the foundation about React and its most important features out
                of the way and applied to our course project, we're going to take the next step in this
                module. We're going to have a look at three very important concepts which you need to
                know as a React developer and that will be effects, reducers and context.

                These features are a little bit more advanced which does not mean that they're difficult.
                This just means you need to know the other concepts first, which is why we are now
                diving into those concepts here and with those features, you will be able to make a huge
                step forward towards more complex React applications.

                In this module, we will therefore take a closer look at what effects are and how you
                can work with so-called side effects which is what effects means. We'll have a look at
                how we can manage more complex state in our Components with reducers and we will explore
                app-wide or at least component-wide state, so state that affect multiple Components
                with a concept called context which is built into React to make sharing state and state
                updates across Components easier.
