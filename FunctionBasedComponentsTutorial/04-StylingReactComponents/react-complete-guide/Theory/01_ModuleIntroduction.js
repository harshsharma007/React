                Building web apps with React is not just about composing Components together and making
                sure that the logic works correctly. That arguably is the most important part, where at
                least it's the biggest reason for using React. But building React apps is also about
                styling those apps. You want to make sure that your applications look good.

                Styling is also an important part of building Components and there are different
                techniques for setting styles dynamically and for styling Components such that other
                Components are not affected by a specific Component's styles. Therefore, in this module
                we will dive into how you can set up styles in a conditional or dynamic way.

                For example, how you can switch certain styles based on some conditions. For example, if
                a user enters an invalid input and you want to color the input field red, something like
                that. Then we'll dive into two popular approaches for scoping styles to Components, for
                setting up styles such that they only affect the Component and are not added as global
                styles.

                We will have a look at styled Components, which is a third-party library, a very popular
                one, which allows us to set up pre-styled Components with their own scoped styles. And
                we'll have a look at a concept called CSS modules. And you will learn what these
                different approaches are all about, how you do work with them, and how you could add
                them to your next project.

                To dive into styling, we need a demo project, and to mix things up I got a brand new
                project here. Now I already prepared this one for you. It's a very simple project as you
                can tell. You can basically add course goals, like Learn React, and that will be added
                to the list. You can also delete items from there by clicking on them.

                This project uses only things which I covered over the last course sections. After
                downloading the project simply open a terminal and navigate to this project folder and
                run:

                npm install

                This will install all the third-party packages which are required and recreates the
                node modules folder. Thereafter, you can start the project with the command:

                npm start
            */}
        </p>
    )
