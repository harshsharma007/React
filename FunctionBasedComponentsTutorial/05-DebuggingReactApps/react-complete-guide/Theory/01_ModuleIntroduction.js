                We learned a lot about some of the most important features of React, also about its core
                pillars and how you style React apps. When you're building apps with React, or in
                general, if you're working as a developer, you will encounter errors that will always
                happen you'll never write code that is error free.

                During your development process, you will always face errors. And in this module, you
                will learn how to debug React apps. How you can find and fix errors because that's one
                of the most important things you need to be able to do as a developer, it's often
                overlooked and I see way too many developers that ask immediately that they get an error.

                They immediately look for others to help them and that's the wrong approach, you need
                to be able to find and solve errors on our own because errors will always be a part of
                development. Therefore in this module, we will explore how you can make sense of the
                error messages React throws at you in certain circumstances.

                We will learn how we can debug and analyze React apps in general, how we can understand
                our code whilst it's executing and we'll explore the React Dev Tools, an extra extension
                we can install in the browser to get a better React developer experience.
