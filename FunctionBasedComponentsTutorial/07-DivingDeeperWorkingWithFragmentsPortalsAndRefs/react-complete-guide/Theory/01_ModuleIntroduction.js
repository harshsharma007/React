                In this module, it's time for Fragments, Portals and Refs. Now, what's that?

                That will be more tools in our React toolbox that help us solve more problems. And in
                this module, we'll simply go through these different features and you will learn which
                problems they solve and why we need them and how you can use them.

                We will have a look at the limitations we're actually facing with JSX code and how
                fragments can help us overcome those limitations. We'll learn how we can drive a cleaner
                DOM, a better code structure with the help of portals and we'll work with Refs and
                learn what Refs actually are and we we need them.
