                1. What does this code snippet do?
                   someArray.map((element) => <p>{element}</p>)
                A. It transforms an array (someArray) into a new array full of JSX elements (which can 
                    be output by React).

                2. Why should you add the special "key" prop to list JSX elements?
                A. It's required for React to correctly identify and update (if needed) the list elements.

                3. What's true about outputting conditional content in React Components?
                A. You can work with regular ternary expressions of if checks to output or return
                   different results in / from your Component.
