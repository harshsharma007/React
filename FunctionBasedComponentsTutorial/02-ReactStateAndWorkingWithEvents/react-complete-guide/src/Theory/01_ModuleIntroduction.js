                In this module, we are going to take a closer look at user interaction and handling
                user events like clicks or input into text fields and so on. And we are going to have a
                look at the very important concept of state in React apps.

                With React, we follow declarative approach, in the end we define desired target states
                and React then takes care about reaching that state.
