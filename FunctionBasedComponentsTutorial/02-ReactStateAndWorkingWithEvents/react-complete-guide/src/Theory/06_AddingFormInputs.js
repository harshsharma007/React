                To be able to listen to the user input let's add a new category of Components. Because
                thus far the Expense Component we have here are about outputting expenses to the screen.
                Now I want to gather user input. Therefore I will a new subfolder in the Components
                folder and I will simply name it NewExpense.

                Therefore, we can add a new file with the name NewExpense.js, which will hold the new
                Expense Component and inside this Component we can render a form where user can input
                their expense data.

                To make our code lean, we can create a form in another component with the name
                ExpenseForm.js.

export default AddingFormInputs;
