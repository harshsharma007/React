                1. What kind of code do you write when using React.js?
                A. Declarative JavaScript Code.

                2. What is JSX?
                A. It's a special, non-standard syntax which is enabled in React projects.

                3. Why is React all about "Components"?
                A. Every UI in the end is made up of multiple building blocks (= Components), hence it
                   makes sense to think about user interfaces as "combinations of Components".
                
                4. What does "declarative" mean?
                A. You define the desired outcome (e.g. a target UI) and let the library (React) figure
                   out the steps.
                
                5. What is a "React Component"?
                A. It's a JavaScript function which typically returns HTML (JSX) code that should be
                   displayed.
                
                6. How many custom React Components must a React app have?
                A. That's totally up to you.

                7. Which statement is correct?
                A. With React, you build a Component tree with one root Component that's mounted into a
                   DOM node.
                
                8. What does "component tree" mean?
                A. It means that you have a root node which then has more components nested beneath it.

                9. How do you pass data between components?
                A. Via "custom HTML attributes" (better known as "props").

                10. How can you output dynamic data in React Components (i.e. in the returned JSX code)?
                A.  You can use single curly braces (opening & closing) with any JS expression between
                    them.
